Programming Models for Distributed Computation
==============================================

Source repo for the book that I and my students in my course at Northeastern University, [CS7680 Special Topics in Computing Systems: Programming Models for Distributed Computing](http://heather.miller.am/teaching/cs7680/) are writing on the topic of programming models for distributed systems.

This is a book about the programming constructs we use to build distributed systems. These range from the small, RPC, futures, actors, to the large; systems built up of these components like MapReduce and Spark. We explore issues concerns central to distributed systems like consistency, availability, and fault tolerance, from the lense of framework the programmer uses to build systems with properties such as these.
