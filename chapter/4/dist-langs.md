### Two major major, orthogonal approaches to distributed languages:

#### Actor / Object model

* Erlang
* Cloud Haskell (I know, right? Why?)

#### Dataflow model

The dataflow model has its roots in functional programming.
Some languages that use this model are:

* Multilisp
* MapReduce (Spark, Hadoop, etc.)

### Why GPL's not DSL's?

* problem of domain-composition
* problem of abstraction
* problem of ecosystem
* problem of tumultuous architecture
* "any gpl + library can act as a dsl" - mernik"
